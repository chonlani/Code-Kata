        Margaret was a small girl. She was a little girl. All her friends were taller than her. 
        She was shorter than all her friends. She wanted to be tall. Her mom told her not to worry. 
        One day Margaret would be tall. One day she would be taller than her friends. One day all her friends would be shorter than her. 
        She was happy to hear that. She only had one question for her mom. 
        When would she be taller than her friends? Would it be next year? She hoped it would be next year. 
        She was tired of being the shortest girl.
