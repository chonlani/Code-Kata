    <p>
        Barbara likes funny stories. She likes to hear funny stories. 
        She likes to tell funny stories. She told her mom a funny story. 
        When she finished, she waited for her mom to laugh. "Mom, why aren't you laughing? That was a funny story," Barbara said. 
        "Oh, I'm sorry," her mom said. "Sometimes you think something is funny, but someone else thinks it isn't funny.
        " So, Barbara's mom did not laugh at Barbara's story. Barbara told the same story to her younger sister. 
        Her younger sister laughed at the story.
