    <p> Ken Binmore discusses the definition of common knowledge in game theory: </p>
    <blockquote>
        Something is common knowledge if everybody knows it, everybody
        knows that everybody knows it, everybody knows that everybody knows
        that everybody knows it; and so on. If nothing is saidto the contrary in a
        rational analysis of a game, it is always implicitly being assumed that both
        the game and the rationality of the players are common knowledge.
