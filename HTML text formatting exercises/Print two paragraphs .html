        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary ate a blueberry. She loved blueberries. 
        Then she ate a blackberry. She loved blackberries. Then she ate a strawberry. She loved strawberries. 
        Mary was confused. A blueberry is blue, so you call it a blueberry. 
        A blackberry is black, so you call it a blackberry. A strawberry is red. 
        So, why don't you call it a redberry? Mary asked her mom. Her mom didn't know. She asked her dad. Her dad didn't know. 
        She asked her little brother. "Because a red berry is a cherry!" her brother said.
